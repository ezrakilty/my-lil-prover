WORK IN PROGRESS!!

This is a little toy propositional theorem-prover, for exploration and
learning purposes.

One of the things I want to do is to create a good "challenge generator":
something to generate propositions that are "interesting" for a human (or a
robot) to try and prove. To be "interesting" is something like to be full of
variables (not a lot of T and _|_ constants), to be relevant (assumptions
should be used, most or all of the time) and perhaps to be linear (each
assumption used just once). Perhaps I'll create a generator for linear, affine
and relevant terms, or something that is has a knob that moves you gradually
through that space.
